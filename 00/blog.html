<h3>Diablerie counter</h3>
<p>
  This blog proposes a new mechanic for <strong>Vampire: The Eternal Struggle</strong>.
  Whenever a vampire commits <em>diablerie</em> a counter is placed on them, simply called
  a "diablerie counter".
</p>
<p>
  The counter does not have to have any codified effects on its own. Instead, the
  significance of the counter can depend on future card designs which reference the counter.
  This proposition as such is sound, as it has no effect on its own, albeit there is a hidden cost 
  to tracking yet another counter. Instead, how it plays
  out will be entirely dependent on how the cards that reference this new token or counter
  function.
</p>

    Surely players would come up with the tokens to use for this purpose. 
    There definitely can be too many types of tokens and counters.
    This seems fundamental enough to warrant one?

</figure>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
  The purpose of this proposition is to provide a mechanism to create the potential for
  secondary long-term consequences for <em>diablerie</em>, in addition to the primary and immediate
  consequence of the <em>bloodhunt referendum</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes <em>bloodhunts</em> don't occur for the diablerist due to opportunistic and
  temporary reasons, or the <em>Methuselah</em> knows they can get away with it without
  repercussions relatively easily. After the referendum, there is nothing (mostly).
</p>
<p>
  The current cards which reference diablerists typically have a window within which they
  can be played, such that it's the turn after, or during the act. 
  It's rare enough so that it's not worthwhile to play
  most of the current cards that reference it, and because they
  don't have alternative uses.
</p>
<p>
  See for example:<br>
  <em>Subdued by the Blood</em>, <br>
  <em>Crimson Fury</em>, <br>
  <em>Sixth Tradition: Destruction</em>, <br>
  <em>The Deadliest Sin</em>. <br>
</p>
<p>
  For the acting diablerist there are several cards that are played, because for the active
  player the frequency of this event is much more in their control, and they're mostly
  related to avoiding the bloodhunt. The cards for the reacting party are not commonly played.

<h3>Lore supports the persistence of diablerie consequences</h3>
<p>
  In <em>the World of Darkness</em> and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> vampires with
  <em>Auspex</em> can detect diablerists. Among the <em>Camarilla</em>, this sin is considered the ultimate crime.
</p>

<h3>The brutality of VTES can be off-putting.</h3>
<p>
  Although the World of Darkness can be violent and mature, it can lead to downsides in a
  5-player social game. If someone loses quickly in a 2-player game, that's fine, it's the
  end of the game. In a multiplayer game that can mean that one person has to leave early
  while the game continues, or just suffer through the rest of it out of courtesy.
</p>
<p>
  The table balance guards against this kind of problem. Other players won’t let someone
  commit an opportunistic diablerie if it wrecks the balance, for example. This kind of guard rail is
  exquisite — it doesn’t feel like an arbitrary hardcoded rule, but rather is something
  that flourishes on the abstract level of player culture. 
</p>
<p>
  However, it doesn’t work always. And it should not work always, either. For example, if
  <em>bloodhunt</em> was guaranteed, there would be no referendum, 
  and it wouldn't be interesting at all. 
  But this can result in situations where someone by chance happens to get into a position
  where they can get away with diablerie for no consequence — for example, due to a
  temporary vote lock in the early game.
</p>
<p>
  This proposition is not out to make diablerie impossible, nor
  is it to say the current system has a flaw. New effects don't have to all be negative. 
  If successful, this mechanic won't be merely another arbitrary counter,
  bloodhunt would still be the primary consequence,
  it could add a little bit of extra strategy and a reason to hesitate to the decision making process,
  provide an opportunity for new designs, at best might on average improve the players' experience, 
  and slightly tip the scales against amaranth.
